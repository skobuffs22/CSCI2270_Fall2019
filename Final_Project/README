To run the code:
  g++ driver.cpp
The rest of the files (including the data sets) are included in the driver.cpp file

NOTE:
    Every option in the menu does work and should not throw any errors; however, the
CuckooHash.cpp has a seg fault error that we were unable to fix. It is explained in
more detail in the report but the code should still run the rest of the files anyways.
