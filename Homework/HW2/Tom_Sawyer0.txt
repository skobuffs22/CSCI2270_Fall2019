potter started on a trot that quickly increased to a run the half breed
stood looking after him he muttered

if hes as much stunned with the lick and fuddled with the rum as he
had the look of being he wont think of the knife till hes gone so
far hell be afraid to come back after it to such a place by
himself chicken heart

two or three minutes later the murdered man the blanketed corpse the
lidless coffin and the open grave were under no inspection but the
moons the stillness was complete again too




chapter x

the two boys flew on and on toward the village speechless with
horror they glanced backward over their shoulders from time to time
apprehensively as if they feared they might be followed every stump
that started up in their path seemed a man and an enemy and made them
catch their breath and as they sped by some outlying cottages that lay
near the village the barking of the aroused watch dogs seemed to give
wings to their feet

if we can only get to the old tannery before we break down whispered
tom in short catches between breaths i cant stand it much longer

huckleberrys hard pantings were his only reply and the boys fixed
their eyes on the goal of their hopes and bent to their work to win it
they gained steadily on it and at last breast to breast they burst
through the open door and fell grateful and exhausted in the sheltering
shadows beyond by and by their pulses slowed down and tom whispered

huckleberry what do you reckonll come of this

if doctor robinson dies i reckon hangingll come of it

do you though

why i know it tom

tom thought a while then he said

wholl tell we

what are you talking about spose something happened and injun joe
didnt hang why hed kill us some time or other just as dead sure
as were a laying here

thats just what i was thinking to myself huck

if anybody tells let muff potter do it if hes fool enough hes
generally drunk enough

tom said nothing went on thinking presently he whispered

huck muff potter dont know it how can he tell

whats the reason he dont know it

because hed just got that whack when injun joe done it dyou reckon
he could see anything dyou reckon he knowed anything

by hokey thats so tom

and besides look a here maybe that whack done for him

no taint likely tom he had liquor in him i could see that and
besides he always has well when paps full you might take and belt
him over the head with a church and you couldnt phase him he says so
his own self so its the same with muff potter of course but if a man
was dead sober i reckon maybe that whack might fetch him i dono

after another reflective silence tom said

hucky you sure you can keep mum

tom we got to keep mum you know that that injun devil wouldnt
make any more of drownding us than a couple of cats if we was to squeak
bout this and they didnt hang him now look a here tom less take
and swear to one another thats what we got to do swear to keep mum

im agreed its the best thing would you just hold hands and swear
that we

oh no that wouldnt do for this thats good enough for little
rubbishy common things specially with gals cuz they go back on you
anyway and blab if they get in a huff but there orter be writing bout
a big thing like this and blood

toms whole being applauded this idea it was deep and dark and awful
the hour the circumstances the surroundings were in keeping with it
he picked up a clean pine shingle that lay in the moon light took a
little fragment of red keel out of his pocket got the moon on
his work and painfully scrawled these lines emphasizing each slow
down stroke by clamping his tongue between his teeth and letting up the
pressure on the up strokes see next page

huck finn and tom sawyer swears they will keep mum about this and they
wish they may drop down dead in their tracks if they ever tell and rot

huckleberry was filled with admiration of toms facility in writing and
the sublimity of his language he at once took a pin from his lapel and
was going to prick his flesh but tom said

hold on dont do that a pins brass it might have verdigrease on
it

whats verdigrease

its pison thats what it is you just swaller some of it once youll
see

so tom unwound the thread from one of his needles and each boy pricked
the ball of his thumb and squeezed out a drop of blood in time after
many squeezes tom managed to sign his initials using the ball of his
little finger for a pen then he showed huckleberry how to make an h and
an f and the oath was complete they buried the shingle close to the
wall with some dismal ceremonies and incantations and the fetters
that bound their tongues were considered to be locked and the key thrown
away

a figure crept stealthily through a break in the other end of the ruined
building now but they did not notice it

tom whispered huckleberry does this keep us from ever
telling always

of course it does it dont make any difference what happens we got
to keep mum wed drop down dead dont you know that

yes i reckon thats so

they continued to whisper for some little time presently a dog set up
a long lugubrious howl just outside within ten feet of them the boys
clasped each other suddenly in an agony of fright

which of us does he mean gasped huckleberry

i dono peep through the crack quick

no you tom

i cant i cant do it huck

please tom there tis again

oh lordy im thankful whispered tom i know his voice its bull
harbison

if mr harbison owned a slave named bull tom would have spoken of
him as harbisons bull but a son or a dog of that name was bull
harbison

oh thats good i tell you tom i was most scared to death id a bet
anything it was a stray dog

the dog howled again the boys hearts sank once more

oh my that aint no bull harbison whispered huckleberry do
tom

tom quaking with fear yielded and put his eye to the crack his
whisper was hardly audible when he said

oh huck its a stray dog

quick tom quick who does he mean

huck he must mean us both were right together

oh tom i reckon were goners i reckon there aint no mistake bout
where ill go to i been so wicked

dad fetch it this comes of playing hookey and doing everything a
fellers told not to do i might a been good like sid if id a
tried but no i wouldnt of course but if ever i get off this time
i lay ill just waller in sunday schools and tom began to snuffle a
little

you bad and huckleberry began to snuffle too consound it tom
sawyer youre just old pie long side o what i am oh lordy
lordy lordy i wisht i only had half your chance

tom choked off and whispered

look hucky look hes got his back to us

hucky looked with joy in his heart

well he has by jingoes did he before

yes he did but i like a fool never thought oh this is bully you
know now who can he mean

the howling stopped tom pricked up his ears

sh whats that he whispered

sounds like like hogs grunting no its somebody snoring tom

that is it where bouts is it huck

i bleeve its down at tother end sounds so anyway pap used to sleep
there sometimes long with the hogs but laws bless you he just lifts
things when he snores besides i reckon he aint ever coming back to
this town any more

the spirit of adventure rose in the boys souls once more

hucky do you dast to go if i lead

i dont like to much tom spose its injun joe

tom quailed but presently the temptation rose up strong again and the
boys agreed to try with the understanding that they would take to their
heels if the snoring stopped so they went tiptoeing stealthily down
the one behind the other when they had got to within five steps of the
snorer tom stepped on a stick and it broke with a sharp snap the man
moaned writhed a little and his face came into the moonlight it was
muff potter the boys hearts had stood still and their hopes too
when the man moved but their fears passed away now they tip toed out
through the broken weather boarding and stopped at a little distance
to exchange a parting word that long lugubrious howl rose on the night
air again they turned and saw the strange dog standing within a few
feet of where potter was lying and facing potter with his nose
pointing heavenward

oh geeminy its him exclaimed both boys in a breath

say tom they say a stray dog come howling around johnny millers
house bout midnight as much as two weeks ago and a whippoorwill come
in and lit on the banisters and sung the very same evening and there
aint anybody dead there yet

well i know that and suppose there aint didnt gracie miller fall
in the kitchen fire and burn herself terrible the very next saturday

yes but she aint dead and whats more shes getting better too

all right you wait and see shes a goner just as dead sure as muff
potters a goner thats what the niggers say and they know all about
these kind of things huck

then they separated cogitating when tom crept in at his bedroom window
the night was almost spent he undressed with excessive caution and
fell asleep congratulating himself that nobody knew of his escapade he
was not aware that the gently snoring sid was awake and had been so for
an hour

when tom awoke sid was dressed and gone there was a late look in the
light a late sense in the atmosphere he was startled why had he not
been called persecuted till he was up as usual the thought filled
him with bodings within five minutes he was dressed and down stairs
feeling sore and drowsy the family were still at table but they had
finished breakfast there was no voice of rebuke but there were averted
eyes there was a silence and an air of solemnity that struck a chill
to the culprits heart he sat down and tried to seem gay but it
was up hill work it roused no smile no response and he lapsed into
silence and let his heart sink down to the depths

after breakfast his aunt took him aside and tom almost brightened in
the hope that he was going to be flogged but it was not so his aunt
wept over him and asked him how he could go and break her old heart so
and finally told him to go on and ruin himself and bring her gray hairs
with sorrow to the grave for it was no use for her to try any more
this was worse than a thousand whippings and toms heart was sorer now
than his body he cried he pleaded for forgiveness promised to reform
over and over again and then received his dismissal feeling that
he had won but an imperfect forgiveness and established but a feeble
confidence

he left the presence too miserable to even feel revengeful toward
sid and so the latters prompt retreat through the back gate was
unnecessary he moped to school gloomy and sad and took his flogging
along with joe harper for playing hookey the day before with the
air of one whose heart was busy with heavier woes and wholly dead to
trifles then he betook himself to his seat rested his elbows on his
desk and his jaws in his hands and stared at the wall with the stony
stare of suffering that has reached the limit and can no further go
his elbow was pressing against some hard substance after a long time
he slowly and sadly changed his position and took up this object with
a sigh it was in a paper he unrolled it a long lingering colossal
sigh followed and his heart broke it was his brass andiron knob

this final feather broke the camels back




chapter xi

close upon the hour of noon the whole village was suddenly electrified
with the ghastly news no need of the as yet un dreamed of telegraph
the tale flew from man to man from group to group from house to house
with little less than telegraphic speed of course the schoolmaster gave
holi day for that afternoon the town would have thought strangely of
him if he had not

a gory knife had been found close to the murdered man and it had been
recognized by somebody as belonging to muff potter so the story ran and
it was said that a belated citizen had come upon potter washing himself
in the branch about one or two oclock in the morning and that potter
had at once sneaked off suspicious circumstances especially the washing
which was not a habit with potter it was also said that the town had
been ransacked for this murderer the public are not slow in the
matter of sifting evidence and arriving at a verdict but that he
could not be found horsemen had departed down all the roads in every
direction and the sheriff was confident that he would be captured
before night

all the town was drifting toward the graveyard toms heartbreak
vanished and he joined the procession not because he would not
a thousand times rather go anywhere else but because an awful
unaccountable fascination drew him on arrived at the dreadful place he
wormed his small body through the crowd and saw the dismal spectacle
it seemed to him an age since he was there before somebody pinched
his arm he turned and his eyes met huckleberrys then both looked
elsewhere at once and wondered if anybody had noticed anything in their
mutual glance but everybody was talking and intent upon the grisly
spectacle before them

poor fellow poor young fellow this ought to be a lesson to grave
robbers muff potterll hang for this if they catch him this was the
drift of remark and the minister said it was a judgment his hand is
here

now tom shivered from head to heel for his eye fell upon the stolid
face of injun joe at this moment the crowd began to sway and struggle
and voices shouted its him its him hes coming himself

who who from twenty voices

muff potter

hallo hes stopped look out hes turning dont let him get away

people in the branches of the trees over toms head said he wasnt
trying to get away he only looked doubtful and perplexed

infernal impudence said a bystander wanted to come and take a quiet
look at his work i reckon didnt expect any company

the crowd fell apart now and the sheriff came through ostentatiously
leading potter by the arm the poor fellows face was haggard and
his eyes showed the fear that was upon him when he stood before the
murdered man he shook as with a palsy and he put his face in his hands
and burst into tears

i didnt do it friends he sobbed pon my word and honor i never
done it

whos accused you shouted a voice

this shot seemed to carry home potter lifted his face and looked around
him with a pathetic hopelessness in his eyes he saw injun joe and
exclaimed

oh injun joe you promised me youd never

is that your knife and it was thrust before him by the sheriff

potter would have fallen if they had not caught him and eased him to the
ground then he said

something told me t if i didnt come back and get he shuddered then
waved his nerveless hand with a vanquished gesture and said tell em
joe tell em it aint any use any more

then huckleberry and tom stood dumb and staring and heard the
stony hearted liar reel off his serene statement they expecting every
moment that the clear sky would deliver gods lightnings upon his head
and wondering to see how long the stroke was delayed and when he had
finished and still stood alive and whole their wavering impulse to
break their oath and save the poor betrayed prisoners life faded and
vanished away for plainly this miscreant had sold himself to satan and
it would be fatal to meddle with the property of such a power as that

why didnt you leave what did you want to come here for somebody
said

i couldnt help it i couldnt help it potter moaned i wanted to
run away but i couldnt seem to come anywhere but here and he fell to
sobbing again

injun joe repeated his statement just as calmly a few minutes
afterward on the inquest under oath and the boys seeing that the
lightnings were still withheld were confirmed in their belief that
joe had sold himself to the devil he was now become to them the most
balefully interesting object they had ever looked upon and they could
not take their fascinated eyes from his face

they inwardly resolved to watch him nights when opportunity should
offer in the hope of getting a glimpse of his dread master

injun joe helped to raise the body of the murdered man and put it in
a wagon for removal and it was whispered through the shuddering
crowd that the wound bled a little the boys thought that this happy
circumstance would turn suspicion in the right direction but they were
disappointed for more than one villager remarked

it was within three feet of muff potter when it done it

toms fearful secret and gnawing conscience disturbed his sleep for as
much as a week after this and at breakfast one morning sid said

tom you pitch around and talk in your sleep so much that you keep me
awake half the time

tom blanched and dropped his eyes

its a bad sign said aunt polly gravely what you got on your mind
tom

nothing nothing t i know of but the boys hand shook so that he
spilled his coffee

and you do talk such stuff sid said last night you said its
blood its blood thats what it is you said that over and over
and you said dont torment me so ill tell tell what what is it
youll tell

everything was swimming before tom there is no telling what might have
happened now but luckily the concern passed out of aunt pollys face
and she came to toms relief without knowing it she said

sho its that dreadful murder i dream about it most every night
myself sometimes i dream its me that done it

mary said she had been affected much the same way sid seemed satisfied
tom got out of the presence as quick as he plausibly could and after
that he complained of toothache for a week and tied up his jaws every
night he never knew that sid lay nightly watching and frequently
slipped the bandage free and then leaned on his elbow listening a good
while at a time and afterward slipped the bandage back to its place
again toms distress of mind wore off gradually and the toothache grew
irksome and was discarded if sid really managed to make anything out of
toms disjointed mutterings he kept it to himself

it seemed to tom that his schoolmates never would get done holding
inquests on dead cats and thus keeping his trouble present to his mind
sid noticed that tom never was coroner at one of these inquiries
though it had been his habit to take the lead in all new enterprises
he noticed too that tom never acted as a witness and that was strange
and sid did not overlook the fact that tom even showed a marked aversion
to these inquests and always avoided them when he could sid marvelled
but said nothing however even inquests went out of vogue at last and
ceased to torture toms conscience

every day or two during this time of sorrow tom watched his
opportunity and went to the little grated jail window and smuggled such
small comforts through to the murderer as he could get hold of the
jail was a trifling little brick den that stood in a marsh at the edge
of the village and no guards were afforded for it indeed it
was seldom occupied these offerings greatly helped to ease toms
conscience

the villagers had a strong desire to tar and feather injun joe and ride
him on a rail for body snatching but so formidable was his character
that nobody could be found who was willing to take the lead in the
matter so it was dropped he had been careful to begin both of his
inquest statements with the fight without confessing the grave robbery
that preceded it therefore it was deemed wisest not to try the case in
the courts at present




chapter xii

one of the reasons why toms mind had drifted away from its secret
troubles was that it had found a new and weighty matter to interest
itself about becky thatcher had stopped coming to school tom had
struggled with his pride a few days and tried to whistle her down the
wind but failed he began to find himself hanging around her fathers
house nights and feeling very miserable she was ill what if she
should die there was distraction in the thought he no longer took an
interest in war nor even in piracy the charm of life was gone there
was nothing but dreariness left he put his hoop away and his bat
there was no joy in them any more his aunt was concerned she began to
try all manner of remedies on him she was one of those people who
are infatuated with patent medicines and all new fangled methods of
producing health or mending it she was an inveterate experimenter in
these things when something fresh in this line came out she was in a
fever right away to try it not on herself for she was never ailing
but on anybody else that came handy she was a subscriber for all the
health periodicals and phrenological frauds and the solemn ignorance
they were inflated with was breath to her nostrils all the rot they
contained about ventilation and how to go to bed and how to get up
and what to eat and what to drink and how much exercise to take and
what frame of mind to keep ones self in and what sort of clothing
to wear was all gospel to her and she never observed that her
health journals of the current month customarily upset everything they
had recommended the month before she was as simple hearted and honest
as the day was long and so she was an easy victim she gathered
together her quack periodicals and her quack medicines and thus armed
with death went about on her pale horse metaphorically speaking with
hell following after but she never suspected that she was not an
angel of healing and the balm of gilead in disguise to the suffering
neighbors

the water treatment was new now and toms low condition was a windfall
to her she had him out at daylight every morning stood him up in the
wood shed and drowned him with a deluge of cold water then she scrubbed
him down with a towel like a file and so brought him to then she
rolled him up in a wet sheet and put him away under blankets till she
sweated his soul clean and the yellow stains of it came through his
pores as tom said

yet notwithstanding all this the boy grew more and more melancholy and
pale and dejected she added hot baths sitz baths shower baths and
plunges the boy remained as dismal as a hearse she began to assist the
water with a slim oatmeal diet and blister plasters she calculated his
capacity as she would a jugs and filled him up every day with quack
cure alls

tom had become indifferent to persecution by this time this phase
filled the old ladys heart with consternation this indifference must
be broken up at any cost now she heard of pain killer for the first
time she ordered a lot at once she tasted it and was filled with
gratitude it was simply fire in a liquid form she dropped the water
treatment and everything else and pinned her faith to pain killer
she gave tom a teaspoonful and watched with the deepest anxiety for the
result her troubles were instantly at rest her soul at peace again
for the indifference was broken up the boy could not have shown a
wilder heartier interest if she had built a fire under him

tom felt that it was time to wake up this sort of life might be
romantic enough in his blighted condition but it was getting to have
too little sentiment and too much distracting variety about it so he
thought over various plans for relief and finally hit upon that of
professing to be fond of pain killer he asked for it so often that he
became a nuisance and his aunt ended by telling him to help himself and
quit bothering her if it had been sid she would have had no misgivings
to alloy her delight but since it was tom she watched the bottle
clandestinely she found that the medicine did really diminish but it
did not occur to her that the boy was mending the health of a crack in
the sitting room floor with it

one day tom was in the act of dosing the crack when his aunts yellow
cat came along purring eyeing the teaspoon avariciously and begging
for a taste tom said

dont ask for it unless you want it peter

but peter signified that he did want it

you better make sure

peter was sure

now youve asked for it and ill give it to you because there aint
anything mean about me but if you find you dont like it you mustnt
blame anybody but your own self

peter was agreeable so tom pried his mouth open and poured down
the pain killer peter sprang a couple of yards in the air and then
delivered a war whoop and set off round and round the room banging
against furniture upsetting flower pots and making general havoc next
he rose on his hind feet and pranced around in a frenzy of enjoyment
with his head over his shoulder and his voice proclaiming his
unappeasable happiness then he went tearing around the house again
spreading chaos and destruction in his path aunt polly entered in time
to see him throw a few double summersets deliver a final mighty hurrah
and sail through the open window carrying the rest of the flower pots
with him the old lady stood petrified with astonishment peering over
her glasses tom lay on the floor expiring with laughter

tom what on earth ails that cat

i dont know aunt gasped the boy

why i never see anything like it what did make him act so

deed i dont know aunt polly cats always act so when theyre having a
good time

they do do they there was something in the tone that made tom
apprehensive

yesm that is i believe they do

you do

yesm

the old lady was bending down tom watching with interest emphasized
by anxiety too late he divined her drift the handle of the telltale
tea spoon was visible under the bed valance aunt polly took it held it
up tom winced and dropped his eyes aunt polly raised him by the usual
handle his ear and cracked his head soundly with her thimble

now sir what did you want to treat that poor dumb beast so for

i done it out of pity for him because he hadnt any aunt

hadnt any aunt you numskull what has that got to do with it

heaps because if hed had one shed a burnt him out herself shed a
roasted his bowels out of him thout any more feeling than if he was a
human

aunt polly felt a sudden pang of remorse this was putting the thing in
a new light what was cruelty to a cat might be cruelty to a boy too
she began to soften she felt sorry her eyes watered a little and she
put her hand on toms head and said gently

i was meaning for the best tom and tom it did do you good

tom looked up in her face with just a perceptible twinkle peeping
through his gravity

i know you was meaning for the best aunty and so was i with peter it
done him good too i never see him get around so since

oh go long with you tom before you aggravate me again and you try
and see if you cant be a good boy for once and you neednt take any
more medicine

tom reached school ahead of time it was noticed that this strange thing
had been occurring every day latterly and now as usual of late
he hung about the gate of the schoolyard instead of playing with his
comrades he was sick he said and he looked it he tried to seem to
be looking everywhere but whither he really was looking down the road
presently jeff thatcher hove in sight and toms face lighted he gazed
a moment and then turned sorrowfully away when jeff arrived tom
accosted him and led up warily to opportunities for remark about
becky but the giddy lad never could see the bait tom watched and
watched hoping whenever a frisking frock came in sight and hating the
owner of it as soon as he saw she was not the right one at last frocks
ceased to appear and he dropped hopelessly into the dumps he entered
the empty schoolhouse and sat down to suffer then one more frock passed
in at the gate and toms heart gave a great bound the next instant he
was out and going on like an indian yelling laughing chasing boys
jumping over the fence at risk of life and limb throwing handsprings
standing on his head doing all the heroic things he could conceive of
and keeping a furtive eye out all the while to see if becky thatcher
was noticing but she seemed to be unconscious of it all she never
looked could it be possible that she was not aware that he was there
he carried his exploits to her immediate vicinity came war whooping
around snatched a boys cap hurled it to the roof of the schoolhouse
broke through a group of boys tumbling them in every direction and
fell sprawling himself under beckys nose almost upsetting her and
she turned with her nose in the air and he heard her say mf some
people think theyre mighty smart always showing off

toms cheeks burned he gathered himself up and sneaked off crushed and
crestfallen




chapter xiii

toms mind was made up now he was gloomy and desperate he was a
forsaken friendless boy he said nobody loved him when they found out
what they had driven him to perhaps they would be sorry he had tried
to do right and get along but they would not let him since nothing
would do them but to be rid of him let it be so and let them blame
him for the consequences why shouldnt they what right had the
friendless to complain yes they had forced him to it at last he would
lead a life of crime there was no choice

by this time he was far down meadow lane and the bell for school to
take up tinkled faintly upon his ear he sobbed now to think he
should never never hear that old familiar sound any more it was very
hard but it was forced on him since he was driven out into the cold
world he must submit but he forgave them then the sobs came thick and
fast

just at this point he met his souls sworn comrade joe
harper hard eyed and with evidently a great and dismal purpose in his
heart plainly here were two souls with but a single thought tom
wiping his eyes with his sleeve began to blubber out something about
a resolution to escape from hard usage and lack of sympathy at home by
roaming abroad into the great world never to return and ended by hoping
that joe would not forget him

but it transpired that this was a request which joe had just been going
to make of tom and had come to hunt him up for that purpose his mother
had whipped him for drinking some cream which he had never tasted and
knew nothing about it was plain that she was tired of him and wished
him to go if she felt that way there was nothing for him to do but
succumb he hoped she would be happy and never regret having driven her
poor boy out into the unfeeling world to suffer and die

as the two boys walked sorrowing along they made a new compact to stand
by each other and be brothers and never separate till death relieved
them of their troubles then they began to lay their plans joe was for
being a hermit and living on crusts in a remote cave and dying
some time of cold and want and grief but after listening to tom he
conceded that there were some conspicuous advantages about a life of
crime and so he consented to be a pirate

three miles below st petersburg at a point where the mississippi river
was a trifle over a mile wide there was a long narrow wooded island
with a shallow bar at the head of it and this offered well as a
rendezvous it was not inhabited it lay far over toward the further
shore abreast a dense and almost wholly unpeopled forest so jacksons
island was chosen who were to be the subjects of their piracies was a
matter that did not occur to them then they hunted up huckleberry finn
and he joined them promptly for all careers were one to him he was
indifferent they presently separated to meet at a lonely spot on the
river bank two miles above the village at the favorite hour which was
midnight there was a small log raft there which they meant to capture
each would bring hooks and lines and such provision as he could steal
in the most dark and mysterious way as became outlaws and before the
afternoon was done they had all managed to enjoy the sweet glory of
spreading the fact that pretty soon the town would hear something all
who got this vague hint were cautioned to be mum and wait

about midnight tom arrived with a boiled ham and a few trifles
and stopped in a dense undergrowth on a small bluff overlooking the
meeting place it was starlight and very still the mighty river lay
like an ocean at rest tom listened a moment but no sound disturbed the
quiet then he gave a low distinct whistle it was answered from under
the bluff tom whistled twice more these signals were answered in the
same way then a guarded voice said

who goes there

tom sawyer the black avenger of the spanish main name your names

huck finn the red handed and joe harper the terror of the seas tom
had furnished these titles from his favorite literature

tis well give the countersign

two hoarse whispers delivered the same awful word simultaneously to the
brooding night

blood

then tom tumbled his ham over the bluff and let himself down after it
tearing both skin and clothes to some extent in the effort there was
an easy comfortable path along the shore under the bluff but it lacked
the advantages of difficulty and danger so valued by a pirate

the terror of the seas had brought a side of bacon and had about worn
himself out with getting it there finn the red handed had stolen a
skillet and a quantity of half cured leaf tobacco and had also brought
a few corn cobs to make pipes with but none of the pirates smoked or
chewed but himself the black avenger of the spanish main said it
would never do to start without some fire that was a wise thought
matches were hardly known there in that day they saw a fire smouldering
upon a great raft a hundred yards above and they went stealthily
thither and helped themselves to a chunk they made an imposing
adventure of it saying hist every now and then and suddenly
halting with finger on lip moving with hands on imaginary dagger hilts
and giving orders in dismal whispers that if the foe stirred to let
him have it to the hilt because dead men tell no tales they knew
well enough that the raftsmen were all down at the village laying
in stores or having a spree but still that was no excuse for their
conducting this thing in an unpiratical way

they shoved off presently tom in command huck at the after oar and
joe at the forward tom stood amidships gloomy browed and with folded
arms and gave his orders in a low stern whisper

luff and bring her to the wind

aye aye sir

steady steady y y y

steady it is sir

let her go off a point

point it is sir

as the boys steadily and monotonously drove the raft toward mid stream
it was no doubt understood that these orders were given only for
style and were not intended to mean anything in particular

what sails she carrying

courses topsls and flying jib sir

send the ryals up lay out aloft there half a dozen of
ye foretopmaststunsl lively now

aye aye sir

shake out that maintogalansl sheets and braces now my hearties

aye aye sir

hellum a lee hard a port stand by to meet her when she comes port
port now men with a will stead y y y

steady it is sir

the raft drew beyond the middle of the river the boys pointed her head
right and then lay on their oars the river was not high so there was
not more than a two or three mile current hardly a word was said during
the next three quarters of an hour now the raft was passing before
the distant town two or three glimmering lights showed where it lay
peacefully sleeping beyond the vague vast sweep of star gemmed water
unconscious of the tremendous event that was happening the black
avenger stood still with folded arms looking his last upon the scene
of his former joys and his later sufferings and wishing she could see
him now abroad on the wild sea facing peril and death with dauntless
heart going to his doom with a grim smile on his lips it was but
a small strain on his imagination to remove jacksons island beyond
eye shot of the village and so he looked his last with a broken and
satisfied heart the other pirates were looking their last too and
they all looked so long that they came near letting the current drift
them out of the range of the island but they discovered the danger in
time and made shift to avert it about two oclock in the morning the
raft grounded on the bar two hundred yards above the head of the island
and they waded back and forth until they had landed their freight part
of the little rafts belongings consisted of an old sail and this they
spread over a nook in the bushes for a tent to shelter their provisions
but they themselves would sleep in the open air in good weather as
became outlaws

they built a fire against the side of a great log twenty or thirty steps
within the sombre depths of the forest and then cooked some bacon in
the frying pan for supper and used up half of the corn pone stock
they had brought it seemed glorious sport to be feasting in that wild
free way in the virgin forest of an unexplored and uninhabited island
far from the haunts of men and they said they never would return to
civilization the climbing fire lit up their faces and threw its ruddy
glare upon the pillared tree trunks of their forest temple and upon the
varnished foliage and festooning vines

when the last crisp slice of bacon was gone and the last allowance
of corn pone devoured the boys stretched themselves out on the grass
filled with contentment they could have found a cooler place but
they would not deny themselves such a romantic feature as the roasting
campfire

aint it gay said joe

its nuts said tom what would the boys say if they could see us

say well theyd just die to be here hey hucky

i reckon so said huckleberry anyways im suited i dont want
nothing bettern this i dont ever get enough to eat genally and here
they cant come and pick at a feller and bullyrag him so

its just the life for me said tom you dont have to get up
mornings and you dont have to go to school and wash and all that
blame foolishness you see a pirate dont have to do anything joe
when hes ashore but a hermit he has to be praying considerable and
then he dont have any fun anyway all by himself that way

oh yes thats so said joe but i hadnt thought much about it you
know id a good deal rather be a pirate now that ive tried it

you see said tom people dont go much on hermits nowadays like
they used to in old times but a pirates always respected and
a hermits got to sleep on the hardest place he can find and put
sackcloth and ashes on his head and stand out in the rain and

what does he put sackcloth and ashes on his head for inquired huck

i dono but theyve got to do it hermits always do youd have to do
that if you was a hermit

dernd if i would said huck

well what would you do

i dono but i wouldnt do that

why huck youd have to howd you get around it

why i just wouldnt stand it id run away

run away well you would be a nice old slouch of a hermit youd be
a disgrace

the red handed made no response being better employed he had finished
gouging out a cob and now he fitted a weed stem to it loaded it with
tobacco and was pressing a coal to the charge and blowing a cloud of
fragrant smoke he was in the full bloom of luxurious contentment the
other pirates envied him this majestic vice and secretly resolved to
acquire it shortly presently huck said

what does pirates have to do

tom said

oh they have just a bully time take ships and burn them and get the
money and bury it in awful places in their island where theres ghosts
and things to watch it and kill everybody in the ships make em walk a
plank

and they carry the women to the island said joe they dont kill the
women

no assented tom they dont kill the women theyre too noble and
the womens always beautiful too

and dont they wear the bulliest clothes oh no all gold and silver
and dimonds said joe with enthusiasm

who said huck

why the pirates

huck scanned his own clothing forlornly

i reckon i aint dressed fitten for a pirate said he with a
regretful pathos in his voice but i aint got none but these

but the other boys told him the fine clothes would come fast enough
after they should have begun their adventures they made him understand
that his poor rags would do to begin with though it was customary for
wealthy pirates to start with a proper wardrobe

gradually their talk died out and drowsiness began to steal upon the
eyelids of the little waifs the pipe dropped from the fingers of the
red handed and he slept the sleep of the conscience free and the weary
the terror of the seas and the black avenger of the spanish main had
more difficulty in getting to sleep they said their prayers inwardly
and lying down since there was nobody there with authority to make them
kneel and recite aloud in truth they had a mind not to say them at
all but they were afraid to proceed to such lengths as that lest they
might call down a sudden and special thunderbolt from heaven then at
once they reached and hovered upon the imminent verge of sleep but an
intruder came now that would not down it was conscience they began
to feel a vague fear that they had been doing wrong to run away and
next they thought of the stolen meat and then the real torture came
they tried to argue it away by reminding conscience that they had
purloined sweetmeats and apples scores of times but conscience was not
to be appeased by such thin plausibilities it seemed to them in the
end that there was no getting around the stubborn fact that taking
sweetmeats was only hooking while taking bacon and hams and such
valuables was plain simple stealing and there was a command against that
in the bible so they inwardly resolved that so long as they remained in
the business their piracies should not again be sullied with the
crime of stealing then conscience granted a truce and these curiously
inconsistent pirates fell peacefully to sleep




chapter xiv

when tom awoke in the morning he wondered where he was he sat up and
rubbed his eyes and looked around then he comprehended it was the cool
gray dawn and there was a delicious sense of repose and peace in the
deep pervading calm and silence of the woods not a leaf stirred not
a sound obtruded upon great natures meditation beaded dewdrops stood
upon the leaves and grasses a white layer of ashes covered the fire
and a thin blue breath of smoke rose straight into the air joe and huck
still slept

now far away in the woods a bird called another answered presently
the hammering of a woodpecker was heard gradually the cool dim gray
of the morning whitened and as gradually sounds multiplied and life
manifested itself the marvel of nature shaking off sleep and going
to work unfolded itself to the musing boy a little green worm came
crawling over a dewy leaf lifting two thirds of his body into the air
from time to time and sniffing around then proceeding again for he
was measuring tom said and when the worm approached him of its own
accord he sat as still as a stone with his hopes rising and falling
by turns as the creature still came toward him or seemed inclined to
go elsewhere and when at last it considered a painful moment with its
curved body in the air and then came decisively down upon toms leg and
began a journey over him his whole heart was glad for that meant that
he was going to have a new suit of clothes without the shadow of a
doubt a gaudy piratical uniform now a procession of ants appeared
from nowhere in particular and went about their labors one struggled
manfully by with a dead spider five times as big as itself in its arms
and lugged it straight up a tree trunk a brown spotted lady bug climbed
the dizzy height of a grass blade and tom bent down close to it and
said lady bug lady bug fly away home your house is on fire your
childrens alone and she took wing and went off to see about it which
did not surprise the boy for he knew of old that this insect was
credulous about conflagrations and he had practised upon its simplicity
more than once a tumblebug came next heaving sturdily at its ball and
tom touched the creature to see it shut its legs against its body
and pretend to be dead the birds were fairly rioting by this time a
catbird the northern mocker lit in a tree over toms head and trilled
out her imitations of her neighbors in a rapture of enjoyment then
a shrill jay swept down a flash of blue flame and stopped on a twig
almost within the boys reach cocked his head to one side and eyed the
strangers with a consuming curiosity a gray squirrel and a big fellow
of the fox kind came skurrying along sitting up at intervals to
inspect and chatter at the boys for the wild things had probably never
seen a human being before and scarcely knew whether to be afraid or not
all nature was wide awake and stirring now long lances of sunlight
pierced down through the dense foliage far and near and a few
butterflies came fluttering upon the scene

tom stirred up the other pirates and they all clattered away with
a shout and in a minute or two were stripped and chasing after and
tumbling over each other in the shallow limpid water of the white
sandbar they felt no longing for the little village sleeping in the
distance beyond the majestic waste of water a vagrant current or a
slight rise in the river had carried off their raft but this only
gratified them since its going was something like burning the bridge
between them and civilization

they came back to camp wonderfully refreshed glad hearted and
ravenous and they soon had the camp fire blazing up again huck found a
spring of clear cold water close by and the boys made cups of broad oak
or hickory leaves and felt that water sweetened with such a wildwood
charm as that would be a good enough substitute for coffee while joe
was slicing bacon for breakfast tom and huck asked him to hold on a
minute they stepped to a promising nook in the river bank and threw in
their lines almost immediately they had reward joe had not had time
to get impatient before they were back again with some handsome bass
a couple of sun perch and a small catfish provisions enough for quite a
family they fried the fish with the bacon and were astonished for
no fish had ever seemed so delicious before they did not know that the
quicker a fresh water fish is on the fire after he is caught the better
he is and they reflected little upon what a sauce open air sleeping
open air exercise bathing and a large ingredient of hunger make too

they lay around in the shade after breakfast while huck had a smoke
and then went off through the woods on an exploring expedition they
tramped gayly along over decaying logs through tangled underbrush
among solemn monarchs of the forest hung from their crowns to the
ground with a drooping regalia of grape vines now and then they came
upon snug nooks carpeted with grass and jeweled with flowers

they found plenty of things to be delighted with but nothing to be
astonished at they discovered that the island was about three miles
long and a quarter of a mile wide and that the shore it lay closest to
was only separated from it by a narrow channel hardly two hundred yards
wide they took a swim about every hour so it was close upon the middle
of the afternoon when they got back to camp they were too hungry to
stop to fish but they fared sumptuously upon cold ham and then threw
themselves down in the shade to talk but the talk soon began to drag
and then died the stillness the solemnity that brooded in the woods
and the sense of loneliness began to tell upon the spirits of the boys
they fell to thinking a sort of undefined longing crept upon them this
took dim shape presently it was budding homesickness even finn the
red handed was dreaming of his doorsteps and empty hogsheads but they
were all ashamed of their weakness and none was brave enough to speak
his thought

for some time now the boys had been dully conscious of a peculiar
sound in the distance just as one sometimes is of the ticking of a
clock which he takes no distinct note of but now this mysterious sound
became more pronounced and forced a recognition the boys started
glanced at each other and then each assumed a listening attitude there
was a long silence profound and unbroken then a deep sullen boom came
floating down out of the distance

what is it exclaimed joe under his breath

i wonder said tom in a whisper

taint thunder said huckleberry in an awed tone becuz thunder

hark said tom listen dont talk

they waited a time that seemed an age and then the same muffled boom
troubled the solemn hush

lets go and see

they sprang to their feet and hurried to the shore toward the town they
parted the bushes on the bank and peered out over the water the little
steam ferry boat was about a mile below the village drifting with the
current her broad deck seemed crowded with people there were a great
many skiffs rowing about or floating with the stream in the neighborhood
of the ferryboat but the boys could not determine what the men in
them were doing presently a great jet of white smoke burst from the
ferryboats side and as it expanded and rose in a lazy cloud that same
dull throb of sound was borne to the listeners again

i know now exclaimed tom somebodys drownded

thats it said huck they done that last summer when bill turner
got drownded they shoot a cannon over the water and that makes
him come up to the top yes and they take loaves of bread and put
quicksilver in em and set em afloat and wherever theres anybody
thats drownded theyll float right there and stop

yes ive heard about that said joe i wonder what makes the bread
do that

oh it aint the bread so much said tom i reckon its mostly what
they say over it before they start it out

but they dont say anything over it said huck ive seen em and
they dont

well thats funny said tom but maybe they say it to themselves of
course they do anybody might know that

the other boys agreed that there was reason in what tom said because
an ignorant lump of bread uninstructed by an incantation could not
be expected to act very intelligently when set upon an errand of such
gravity

by jings i wish i was over there now said joe

i do too said huck id give heaps to know who it is

the boys still listened and watched presently a revealing thought
flashed through toms mind and he exclaimed

boys i know whos drownded its us

they felt like heroes in an instant here was a gorgeous triumph they
were missed they were mourned hearts were breaking on their account
tears were being shed accusing memories of unkindness to these poor
lost lads were rising up and unavailing regrets and remorse were being
indulged and best of all the departed were the talk of the whole town
and the envy of all the boys as far as this dazzling notoriety was
concerned this was fine it was worth while to be a pirate after all

as twilight drew on the ferryboat went back to her accustomed business
and the skiffs disappeared the pirates returned to camp they were
jubilant with vanity over their new grandeur and the illustrious trouble
they were making they caught fish cooked supper and ate it and then
fell to guessing at what the village was thinking and saying about them
and the pictures they drew of the public distress on their account were
gratifying to look upon from their point of view but when the shadows
of night closed them in they gradually ceased to talk and sat gazing
into the fire with their minds evidently wandering elsewhere the
excitement was gone now and tom and joe could not keep back thoughts
of certain persons at home who were not enjoying this fine frolic as
much as they were misgivings came they grew troubled and unhappy a
sigh or two escaped unawares by and by joe timidly ventured upon a
roundabout feeler as to how the others might look upon a return to
civilization not right now but

tom withered him with derision huck being uncommitted as yet joined
in with tom and the waverer quickly explained and was glad to get
out of the scrape with as little taint of chicken hearted home sickness
clinging to his garments as he could mutiny was effectually laid to
rest for the moment

as the night deepened huck began to nod and presently to snore
joe followed next tom lay upon his elbow motionless for some time
watching the two intently at last he got up cautiously on his knees
and went searching among the grass and the flickering reflections flung
by the campfire he picked up and inspected several large semi cylinders
of the thin white bark of a sycamore and finally chose two which seemed
to suit him then he knelt by the fire and painfully wrote something
upon each of these with his red keel one he rolled up and put in his
jacket pocket and the other he put in joes hat and removed it to a
little distance from the owner and he also put into the hat certain
schoolboy treasures of almost inestimable value among them a lump of
chalk an india rubber ball three fishhooks and one of that kind
of marbles known as a sure nough crystal then he tiptoed his way
cautiously among the trees till he felt that he was out of hearing and
straightway broke into a keen run in the direction of the sandbar
